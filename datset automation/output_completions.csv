Vehicle Sales,"The sale of a vehicle is usually the most important part of the car buying process. Once the buyer and seller have reached an agreement on the vehicle's price, the buyer must then proceed to complete the transaction. This usually involves paying the purchase price in full and signing the relevant documents, such as a bill of sale and title transfer paperwork. The seller may also provide the buyer with paperwork related to the car's registration and any applicable warranties. Finally, the buyer may need to obtain auto insurance before taking the vehicle home."
VEHICLE FINANCING,"Vehicle financing is a type of loan that is taken out to purchase cars, trucks, motorbikes, boats, or other types of vehicles. It is typically secured by the vehicle itself, and typically requires a down payment of some type. Vehicle financing can come in varying terms, such as short-term (less than one year) or long-term (more than 5 years). The length of the loan and the interest rate are heavily dependent on the credit score and other financial qualifications of the borrower. Vehicle financing is typically secured by a lien against the vehicle which allows the lender to repossess the vehicle for non-payment."
Wheel Alignment,"Tire alignment is the process of adjusting the angles of wheels to that they are set to the automobile manufacturer specifications. This ensures that the automobile runs straight and true, rather than veering off to one side. It also reduces tire wear, giving your vehicle better fuel efficiency and a longer tire life. Tire alignment is also needed to help keep the steering running smoothly and reduce the vibration of your car."
Vehicle Servicing,"Vehicle servicing is an important part of maintaining a vehicle in top condition. Vehicle servicing includes a variety of tasks and checks that are designed to identify any faults or issues in the vehicle’s mechanical and electrical systems. Services typically involve checks of the engine, transmission, brakes, tyres, suspension, lights, and other components.
